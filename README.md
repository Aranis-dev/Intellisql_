IntelliSQL: Intelligent SQL Querying with LLMs Using Gemini Pro
Overview
IntelliSQL is an innovative application that revolutionizes database interaction by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Google's Gemini Pro. It allows users to query databases using natural language, making complex SQL operations accessible to both novice and experienced users.

Project Description
Scenario 1: Intelligent Query Assistance
IntelliSQL enhances the querying process by providing intelligent assistance to users. Whether they are novice or experienced SQL users, IntelliSQL guides them through crafting complex queries with ease. By understanding natural language queries, IntelliSQL suggests relevant SQL statements, offers syntax suggestions, and assists in optimizing query performance, thereby streamlining the database interaction experience.

Scenario 2: Data Exploration and Insights
For data analysts and researchers, IntelliSQL serves as a powerful tool for exploring and gaining insights from databases. Users can pose natural language questions about the data, and IntelliSQL intelligently translates these queries into SQL commands to retrieve the desired information. With its advanced language understanding capabilities, IntelliSQL facilitates efficient data exploration, enabling users to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights within the database.

Features
Natural Language to SQL Conversion: Translate plain English questions into executable SQL queries using Gemini Pro.

Intelligent Query Assistance: Get suggestions for relevant SQL statements.

Data Exploration: Easily retrieve and display data from your database based on natural language prompts.

User-Friendly Interface: An interactive web application built with Streamlit.

SQLite Integration: Demonstrates database interaction with a lightweight SQLite database.

Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the IntelliSQL application locally.

1. Clone the Repository (or create files manually)
If you're creating the repo, set up the folder structure as shown above.

2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the IntelliSQL_Project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Obtain Google Gemini Pro API Key
Go to Google AI Studio.

Sign in with your Google account.

Click on "Get an API Key" or "Create API Key in new project" (if it's your first time).

Copy the generated API key.

4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root of your IntelliSQL_Project directory. Add the following line to it, replacing YOUR_GENERATED_GOOGLE_API_KEY with the API key you copied:

GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GENERATED_GOOGLE_API_KEY"

Important: For the app.py to pick up this environment variable, you need to load it into your shell's environment before running the Streamlit app.

Linux/macOS:

export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GENERATED_GOOGLE_API_KEY"

Windows (Command Prompt):

set GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GENERATED_GOOGLE_API_KEY

Windows (PowerShell):

$env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GENERATED_GOOGLE_API_KEY"

(You'll need to do this in each new terminal session, or consider using a library like python-dotenv for automatic loading in a more robust local setup, though it's not strictly required for this demo.)

5. Create and Populate the Database
Run the sql.py script to create the data.db SQLite database and populate it with sample Students data:

python sql.py

This will create data.db in your project directory.

6. Run the Streamlit Application
Finally, launch the Streamlit application from your terminal:

streamlit run app.py

This command will open the IntelliSQL application in your default web browser.

Usage
Once the application is running:

Navigate: Use the sidebar to switch between "Home", "Intelligent Query Assistance", and "About IntelliSQL" pages.

Intelligent Query Assistance:

On this page, enter your natural language question about the Students database (e.g., "Show me all students from Infosys.", "What is the average marks scored by students?").

Click "Generate SQL & Get Results".

The application will display the generated SQL query and the results from the database.

You can also execute direct SQL queries using the "Direct SQL Query Execution" section.
